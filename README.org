#+TITLE: jrrom's Literate Configurations

* Reasoning
Hello, I'm [[www.github.com/jrrom][jrrom]]. This is my literate configuration for my daily use. I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] for keeping track of my dotfiles. I used to use [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] but I dislike the Nix interface and prefer doing it "directly." If you see anything you like then feel free to copy!

I am trying to move away from NixOS, and currently in the process of doing so. This is very much still a work in progress.

* TODO
- [X] Move all config files into stow-home
- [ ] Move to Cosmic DE when that releases
- [ ] Add font and theme to personal void-packages repo (look into distancing from Nix)
